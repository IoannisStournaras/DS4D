#Pitch is a python library that is used to create the football pitch 
#This library is submitted as a file named pitch.py
#When you extract the zip, assignment.ipynb and pitch.py should remain in the same folder and no further action from you is required
#If pitch.py and assignment.ipynb are not in the same folder then you should define the path. I used Anaconda/Jupiter Notebook and
	#this can be done by following the steps:
	1)Windows Search
	2)Search for 'Edit Environment Variables for your account'
	3)Create New
	4)Variable name = PYTHONPATH
	5)Variable Path = The pathof the folder you have stored
	6)Restart Jupiter Server
	
#If any other libray is not installed you can install each library by using the command
!pip install (nameofthelibrary)
For example: !pip install sklearn
